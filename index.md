Despite their impressive realism, modern text-to-image models still struggle with compositionality, often failing to render
accurate object counts, attributes, and spatial relations. To address this challenge, we present a training-free framework that
combines an object-centric approach with self-refinement to
improve layout faithfulness while preserving aesthetic quality. Specifically, we leverage large language models (LLMs)
to synthesize explicit layouts from input prompts, and we
inject these layouts into the image generation process, where
a object-centric vision-language model (VLM) judge reranks multiple candidates to select the most prompt-aligned
outcome iteratively. By unifying explicit layout-grounding
with self-refine-based inference-time scaling, our framework
achieves stronger scene alignment with prompts compared
to recent text-to-image models.
